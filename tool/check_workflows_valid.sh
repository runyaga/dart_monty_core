# The workflow files must be VALID, or CI silently stops running.
# =============================================================================
# A workflow GitHub cannot parse does not fail loudly. It records a run with
# ZERO JOBS and conclusion "failure", and — the part that actually hurts — it
# stops matching its own triggers, so the pull_request runs simply cease.
#
# Measured 2026-09-14: a duplicate `env:` key in one step (ci.yaml, added by a
# commit that only meant to pass one more variable) took CI out for THIRTEEN
# COMMITS. Every push produced a 0-job failure, the PR runs stopped entirely,
# and `python3 -c 'import yaml; yaml.safe_load(...)'` passed the whole time —
# PyYAML keeps the last duplicate key, GitHub rejects the document.
#
# So YAML-parses is not the check. This is.
#
# actionlint is fetched on demand and cached; if it cannot be fetched the gate
# SKIPS with a warning rather than failing, because a network hiccup must not
# block a commit — but it says so, so a silent skip is impossible to mistake
# for a pass.
#
# Usage: bash tool/check_workflows_valid.sh
