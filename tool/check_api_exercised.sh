# tool/check_api_exercised.sh — is every public entry point actually PLUMBED?
# =============================================================================
# A mock proves the wiring compiles. It cannot prove the engine can do the
# thing. Monty.compile() had a thorough test file --
# test/unit/platform/monty_compile_test.dart -- written entirely against
# MockMontyPlatform, whose compileCode returns `jsonEncode({'code': code})`.
# Nothing ever called Monty.compile() against FFI or WASM, so the API was green
# in CI and dead in every shipped configuration: native/src/handle.rs:558
# returns Err unconditionally, on every target (core#152).
#
# This asks one question of each public entry point on Monty and MontyRepl:
# does ANY file that runs against a real backend mention it?
#
# THE REAL SURFACE IS THREE DIRECTORIES, NOT ONE. Getting this wrong is how the
# check cries wolf, and a check that cries wolf gets deleted. Measured while
# writing it -- scanning only `test/**/*_test.dart` reported five entry points
# as untested and all five were FALSE:
#
#   test/integration/**   incl. the shared `_*_body.dart` bodies that the
#                         ffi_/wasm_ pairs import -- `typeCheck`,
#                         `resolveFutures` and `resumeAsFuture` live ONLY there
#   example/**            smoke-run by tool/run_example_smoke.sh and by CI --
#                         `clearState` and `detectContinuation` live only here
#   packages/*/lib/**     the conformance runners, driven on real backends by
#                         corpus_js / corpus_wasm / oracle_ffi -- this is the
#                         only caller of `resumeWithException`
#
# The entry-point list is DERIVED from the source, not enumerated here. A
# hand-written list does not grow a row when someone adds a public method, so
# the new method would be exempt from the check by default -- which is the
# failure this exists to prevent, wearing a different hat.
